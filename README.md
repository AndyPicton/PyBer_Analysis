# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

V. Isualize, the CEO of a ride-sharing company, PyBer, has tasked me with creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, Rural, Urban, and Suburban. 

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

As you can see from the above image urban cities had far more total rides than both suburban and rural cities. Urban cities also had higher total drivers and fares but the average fare per ride and driver were smaller. 

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
