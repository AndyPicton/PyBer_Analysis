# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

V. Isualize, the CEO of a ride-sharing company, PyBer, has tasked me with creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, Rural, Urban, and Suburban. 

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
